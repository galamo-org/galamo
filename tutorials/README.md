## Tutorials

Galamo offers a suite of well-documented tutorials and examples to guide users through its core functionalities in galaxy analysis. The tutorials are available through the [official documentation](https://www.galamo.org/learn.html) and GitHub repository, providing a hands-on, structured learning experience.

Currently, Galamo supports three key modules:

1. **BPT Module**
   Designed for AGN classification using spectral data, this module utilizes the Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich (BPT) diagnostic diagram to distinguish between star-forming galaxies, composite regions, Seyfert galaxies, and LINERs.

2. **Galaxy Morphology Classification**
   This module employs machine learning models trained on photometric data to classify galaxies into morphological types such as ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars, supporting both supervised and unsupervised approaches.

3. **Low-Light Image Enhancement**
   Aimed at improving visibility in low signal-to-noise astronomical images, this module enhances features in faint galaxy images and lunar surface data using advanced image processing techniques.

These modules are designed to support a wide range of research applications. For implementation details and example workflows, please refer to the tutorials and notebooks in the [GitHub tutorials section](https://www.galamo.org/learn.html).
