## How the Modules Work (GLimps)

Below are the brief overviews of the main modules in the `Galamo` project, illustrating their workflows and functionalities:

### 1. Galaxy Prediction Based on Photometer Data  
![Galaxy Prediction Module](images/galaxy_morph.png)  
This module processes photometric data to predict galaxy morphologies using advanced machine learning algorithms.

---

### 2. BPT Classification Based on Spectral Data  
![BPT Classification Module](images/bpt.png)  
This module classifies galaxies into Seyfert, LINER, or star-forming using Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagnostic diagrams derived from spectral line ratios.

---

### 3. PSR Module for Low-Light Image Enhancement  
![PSR Module](images/psr.png)  
The PSR module enhances low-light astronomical images to improve feature detection and analysis through state-of-the-art image processing techniques.
